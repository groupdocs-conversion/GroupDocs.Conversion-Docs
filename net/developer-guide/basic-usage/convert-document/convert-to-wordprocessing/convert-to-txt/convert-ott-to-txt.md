Files with OTT extension represent template documents generated by applications in compliance with the OASIS' OpenDocument standard format. These are created with word processor applications such as free OpenOffice Writer and can hold settings that can be used to generate new documents from these template files. These settings include page margins, borders, headers, footers, and other page settings. Such templates are used in official documents such as company letterheads and standardized forms.

## Steps to convert OTT to TXT in C#

[GroupDocs.Conversion](https://products.groupdocs.com/conversion/net) allows developers to convert the OTT file to TXT format in an easy and intuitive way just using a few lines of code as described below:

* Create an instance of `Converter` class and pass source OTT file path as a constructor parameter. You may specify absolute or relative file path as per your requirements. 
* Create an instance of `WordProcessingConvertOptions` class and set `Format` property to `GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.WordProcessingFileType.Txt`
* Call `Converter` class `Convert` method and pass the filename for the converted TXT file and the `WordProcessingConvertOptions` object from the previous step as parameters.

```csharp
// Load the source OTT file
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter("sample.ott"))
{
    // Set the convert options for TXT format
   WordProcessingConvertOptions options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.WordProcessingFileType.Txt };
    // Convert to TXT format
    converter.Convert("converted.txt", options);
