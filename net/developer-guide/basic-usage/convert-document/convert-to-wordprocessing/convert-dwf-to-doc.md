Design Web Format (DWF) represents 2D/3D drawing in compressed format for viewing, reviewing, or printing design files. It contains graphics and text as part of design data and reduces the size of the file due to its compressed format. The reduced file size makes the distribution and communication of rich design data efficient. DWF doesn't require the recipient to know about the usage of CAD software that created the original drawing.

## Steps to convert DWF to DOC in C#

[GroupDocs.Conversion](https://products.groupdocs.com/conversion/net) allows developers to convert the DWF file to DOC format in an easy and intuitive way just using a few lines of code as described below:

* Create an instance of `Converter` class and pass source DWF file path as a constructor parameter. You may specify absolute or relative file path as per your requirements. 
* Create an instance of `WordProcessingConvertOptions` class.
* Call `Converter` class `Convert` method and pass the filename for the converted DOC file and the `WordProcessingConvertOptions` object from the previous step as parameters.

```csharp
// Load the source DWF file
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter("sample.dwf"))
{
    // Set the convert options for DOC format
    WordProcessingConvertOptions options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions();
    // Convert to DOC format
    converter.Convert("converted.doc", options);
}
```
