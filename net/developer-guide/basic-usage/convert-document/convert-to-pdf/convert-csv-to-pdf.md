Files with CSV (Comma Separated Values) extension represent plain text files that contain records of data with comma separated values. Each line in a CSV file is a new record from the set of records contained in the file. Such files are generated when data transfer is intended from one storage system to another. Since all applications can recognize records separated by comma, import of such data files to database is done very conveniently.

To convert from Comma Separated Values File (.csv) to Portable Document (.pdf) in C# just call `Convert` method like shown below:

```csharp
// Load the source CSV file
using (Converter converter = new Converter("sample.csv"))
{
    PdfConvertOptions options = new PdfConvertOptions();
    // Save converted PDF file
    converter.Convert("converted.pdf", options);
}
```
