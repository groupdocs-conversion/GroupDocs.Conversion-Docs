Files with CSV (Comma Separated Values) extension represent plain text files that contain records of data with comma separated values. Each line in a CSV file is a new record from the set of records contained in the file. Such files are generated when data transfer is intended from one storage system to another. Since all applications can recognize records separated by comma, import of such data files to database is done very conveniently.

## Steps to convert CSV to PDF in C#

[GroupDocs.Conversion](https://products.groupdocs.com/conversion/net) allows developers to convert the CSV file to PDF format in an easy and intuitive way just using a few lines of code as described below:

* Create an instance of `Converter` class and pass source CSV file path as a constructor parameter. You may specify absolute or relative file path as per your requirements. 
* Create an instance of `PdfConvertOptions` class.
* Call `Converter` class `Convert` method and pass the filename for the converted PDF file and the `PdfConvertOptions` object from the previous step as parameters.

```csharp
// Load the source CSV file
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter("sample.csv"))
{
    // Set the convert options for PDF format
   var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
    // Convert to PDF format
    converter.Convert("converted.pdf", options);
}
```
