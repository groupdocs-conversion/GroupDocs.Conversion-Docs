A Tab-Separated Values (TSV) file format represents data separated with tabs in plain text format. The file format, similar to CSV, is used for organization of data in a structured manner in order to import and export between different applications. The format is primarily used for data import/export and exchange in Spreadsheet applications and databases. 

## Steps to convert TSV to PDF in C#

[GroupDocs.Conversion](https://products.groupdocs.com/conversion/net) allows developers to convert the TSV file to PDF format in an easy and intuitive way just using a few lines of code as described below:

* Create an instance of `Converter` class and pass source TSV file path as a constructor parameter. You may specify absolute or relative file path as per your requirements. 
* Create an instance of `PdfConvertOptions` class.
* Call `Converter` class `Convert` method and pass the filename for the converted PDF file and the `PdfConvertOptions` object from the previous step as parameters.

```csharp
// Load the source TSV file
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter("sample.tsv"))
{
    // Set the convert options for PDF format
   var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
    // Convert to PDF format
    converter.Convert("converted.pdf", options);
}
```
