## About 3D file formats

The electronic representation of a three-dimensional object is known as a 3D file. A 3D file format is used to store information about 3D models. It usually stores information about 3D models as plain text or binary data. There are literally hundreds of 3D file formats that are widely used in 3D games, printing, computer-aided design, manufacturing, academia, engineering and more. Each industry has its own 3D file formats for several reasons. 

## Supported 3D file conversions

## Convert from 3D formats

With [GroupDocs.Conversion](https://products.groupdocs.com/conversion/net) you can easily convert your 3D document into another file format.  
For example 3D to PDF conversion code snippet will look like this:

```csharp
// Load the source 3D file
using (Converter converter = new Converter("sample.3ds"))
{
    // Set the convert options for PDF format
    PdfConvertOptions options = new PdfConvertOptions();
    // Convert to PDF format
    converter.Convert("converted.pdf", options);
}
```

Put it simply - you just load a 3D file into the `Converter` class, select the desired output format and all the rest will be done by **GroupDocs.Conversion**.

## Convert to another 3D format

On the other hand, converting your files to another 3D format is also quite simple and natural.
The following code sample demonstrates how to convert 3DS document to FBX in C# using [GroupDocs.Conversion](https://products.groupdocs.com/conversion/net).

```csharp
// Load the source 3DS file
using (Converter converter = new Converter("sample.3ds"))
{
    // Set the convert options for 3D format
    var options = new ThreeDConvertOptions { 
       Format = ThreeDFileType.Fbx
    };
    // Convert to FBX format
    converter.Convert("converted.fbx", options);
}
```
