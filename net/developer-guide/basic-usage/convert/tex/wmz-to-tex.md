A file with .wmz extension is an intermediate level file generated by older versions of Microsoft Office applications. It can contain embedded equations, clip art, or other vector graphics.

## Steps to convert WMZ to TEX in C#

[GroupDocs.Conversion](https://products.groupdocs.com/conversion/net) allows developers to convert the WMZ file to TEX format in an easy and intuitive way just using a few lines of code as described below:

* Create an instance of `Converter` class and pass source WMZ file path as a constructor parameter. You may specify absolute or relative file path as per your requirements. 
* Create an instance of `PdfConvertOptions` class and set `Format` property to `GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.PdfFileType.Tex`.
* Call `Converter` class `Convert` method and pass the filename for the converted TEX file and the `PdfConvertOptions` object from the previous step as parameters.

```csharp
// Load the source WMZ file
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter("sample.wmz"))
{
    // Set the convert options for TEX format
   var options = new PdfConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.PdfFileType.Tex };
    // Convert to TEX format
    converter.Convert("converted.tex", options);
}
