The XLTM file extension represents files that are generated by Microsoft Excel as Macro-enabled template files. XLTM files are similar to XLTX in structure other than that the later doesn't support creating template files with macros. Such template files are used to generate and set the layout, formatting, and other settings along with the macros to facilitate creating similar XLSX files then.

## Steps to convert XLTM to DOCX in C#

[GroupDocs.Conversion](https://products.groupdocs.com/conversion/net) allows developers to convert the XLTM file to DOCX format in an easy and intuitive way just using a few lines of code as described below:

* Create an instance of `Converter` class and pass source XLTM file path as a constructor parameter. You may specify absolute or relative file path as per your requirements. 
* Create an instance of `WordProcessingConvertOptions` class.
* Call `Converter` class `Convert` method and pass the filename for the converted DOCX file and the `WordProcessingConvertOptions` object from the previous step as parameters.

```csharp
// Load the source XLTM file
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter("sample.xltm"))
{
    // Set the convert options for DOCX format
   var options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions();
    // Convert to DOCX format
    converter.Convert("converted.docx", options);
}
```
