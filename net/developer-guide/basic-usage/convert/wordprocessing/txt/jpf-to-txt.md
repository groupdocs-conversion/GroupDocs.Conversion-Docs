JPEG 2000 is an image coding system and state-of-the-art image compression standard. It uses wavelet technology to code lossless content in any quality at once. Moreover, without any substantial penalty in coding efficiency, JPEG 2000 has the capability to access and decode the same content efficaciously into a variety of other resolutions and qualities. The code streams in JPEG 2000 are significantly scalable having regions of interest that provide the facility for spatial random access.

## Steps to convert JPF to TXT in C#

[GroupDocs.Conversion](https://products.groupdocs.com/conversion/net) allows developers to convert the JPF file to TXT format in an easy and intuitive way just using a few lines of code as described below:

* Create an instance of `Converter` class and pass source JPF file path as a constructor parameter. You may specify absolute or relative file path as per your requirements. 
* Create an instance of `WordProcessingConvertOptions` class and set `Format` property to `GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.WordProcessingFileType.Txt`.
* Call `Converter` class `Convert` method and pass the filename for the converted TXT file and the `WordProcessingConvertOptions` object from the previous step as parameters.

```csharp
// Load the source JPF file
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter("sample.jpf"))
{
    // Set the convert options for TXT format
   var options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.WordProcessingFileType.Txt };
    // Convert to TXT format
    converter.Convert("converted.txt", options);
}
```
