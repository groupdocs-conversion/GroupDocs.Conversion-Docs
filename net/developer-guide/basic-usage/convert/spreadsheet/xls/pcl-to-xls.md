PCL stands for Printer Command Language which is a Page Description Language introduced by Hewlett Packard (HP). HP created PCL to provide an efficient way of controlling printer features across many different printing devices. The format was originally developed for HPâ€™s dot-matrix and Inkjet printers but has been part of various thermal, matrix, and page printers with the passage of time. The format underwent several different revisions, resulting in different versions where each version was enhanced to meet the demands of time with respect to the printer control features

## Steps to convert PCL to XLS in C#

[GroupDocs.Conversion](https://products.groupdocs.com/conversion/net) allows developers to convert the PCL file to XLS format in an easy and intuitive way just using a few lines of code as described below:
