## About Spreadsheet File Formats

A **spreadsheet** file contains data in the form of rows and columns. A spreadsheet file can be saved in several different file formats, each having a different file extension for unique representation. Data is stored in cells either in plain form such as text string, numbers, date, currency, etc. or as formulas that change a cellâ€™s value when referenced cell values change.

Common spreadsheet file extensions and their file formats include **XLSX** (Microsoft Excel Open XML Spreadsheet), **ODS** (OpenDocument Spreadsheet) and **XLS** (Microsoft Excel Binary File Format).
