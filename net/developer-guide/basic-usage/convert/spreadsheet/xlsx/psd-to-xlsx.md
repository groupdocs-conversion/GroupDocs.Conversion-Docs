PSD, Photoshop Document, represents Adobe Photoshop's native file format used for graphics designing and development. PSD files may include image layers, adjustment layers, layer masks, annotations, file information, keywords, and other Photoshop-specific elements. Photoshop files have default extension as PSD and have a maximum height and width of 30,000 pixels, and a length limit of two gigabytes.

## Steps to convert PSD to XLSX in C#

[GroupDocs.Conversion](https://products.groupdocs.com/conversion/net) allows developers to convert the PSD file to XLSX format in an easy and intuitive way just using a few lines of code as described below:

* Create an instance of `Converter` class and pass source PSD file path as a constructor parameter. You may specify absolute or relative file path as per your requirements. 
* Create an instance of `SpreadsheetConvertOptions` class.
* Call `Converter` class `Convert` method and pass the filename for the converted XLSX file and the `SpreadsheetConvertOptions` object from the previous step as parameters.

```csharp
// Load the source PSD file
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter("sample.psd"))
{
    // Set the convert options for XLSX format
   var options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions();
    // Convert to XLSX format
    converter.Convert("converted.xlsx", options);
}
```
