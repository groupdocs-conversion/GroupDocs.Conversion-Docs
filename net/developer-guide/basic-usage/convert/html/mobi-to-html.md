The MOBI file format is one of the most widely used ebook file formats. The format is an enhancement to the old OEB (Open Ebook Format) format and was used as the proprietary format for Mobipocket Reader. Like EPUB, it is supported by almost all modern e-readers specifically by mobile devices with low bandwidth. The format can be converted to several other formats such as PDF, EPUB, and several other formats using publicly available software applications such as the Kindle app.

## Steps to convert MOBI to HTML in C#

[GroupDocs.Conversion](https://products.groupdocs.com/conversion/net) allows developers to convert the MOBI file to HTML format in an easy and intuitive way just using a few lines of code as described below:

* Create an instance of `Converter` class and pass source MOBI file path as a constructor parameter. You may specify absolute or relative file path as per your requirements. 
* Create an instance of `MarkupConvertOptions` class.
* Call `Converter` class `Convert` method and pass the filename for the converted HTML file and the `MarkupConvertOptions` object from the previous step as parameters.

```csharp
// Load the source MOBI file
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter("sample.mobi"))
