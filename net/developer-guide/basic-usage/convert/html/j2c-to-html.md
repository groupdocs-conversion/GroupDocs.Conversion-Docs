A J2C file is an image that is compressed using wavelet compression instead of DCT compression format defined in Part 1 of the JPEG 2000 standard.

## Steps to convert J2C to HTML in C#

[GroupDocs.Conversion](https://products.groupdocs.com/conversion/net) allows developers to convert the J2C file to HTML format in an easy and intuitive way just using a few lines of code as described below:

* Create an instance of `Converter` class and pass source J2C file path as a constructor parameter. You may specify absolute or relative file path as per your requirements. 
* Create an instance of `MarkupConvertOptions` class.
* Call `Converter` class `Convert` method and pass the filename for the converted HTML file and the `MarkupConvertOptions` object from the previous step as parameters.

```csharp
// Load the source J2C file
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter("sample.j2c"))
{
    // Set the convert options for HTML format
   var options = new MarkupConvertOptions();
    // Convert to HTML format
    converter.Convert("converted.html", options);
}
```
