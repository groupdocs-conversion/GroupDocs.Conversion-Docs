The EMLX file format is implemented and developed by Apple. The Apple Mail application uses the EMLX file format for exporting the emails. There are other applications as well such as GroupDocs.Conversion App that can open the EMLX files and convert these to other file formats.

## Steps to convert EMLX to HTML in C#

[GroupDocs.Conversion](https://products.groupdocs.com/conversion/net) allows developers to convert the EMLX file to HTML format in an easy and intuitive way just using a few lines of code as described below:

* Create an instance of `Converter` class and pass source EMLX file path as a constructor parameter. You may specify absolute or relative file path as per your requirements. 
* Create an instance of `MarkupConvertOptions` class.
* Call `Converter` class `Convert` method and pass the filename for the converted HTML file and the `MarkupConvertOptions` object from the previous step as parameters.

```csharp
// Load the source EMLX file
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter("sample.emlx"))
{
    // Set the convert options for HTML format
   var options = new MarkupConvertOptions();
    // Convert to HTML format
