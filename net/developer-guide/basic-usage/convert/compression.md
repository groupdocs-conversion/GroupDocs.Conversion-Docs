## About compression file formats

File compression is the process of reducing the size of one or more files. It shrinks big files into much smaller ones by removing unneeded data. The compressed file archive makes it easier to send and back up large files or groups of files. Moreover, such files make downloading faster and easier, besides, they allow more data to be stored on removable media. There are various compression formats. Below we are going to describe how to convert the most popular compression file formats using GroupDocs.Conversion.

## Supported compression file conversions

## Extract from ZIP

With [GroupDocs.Conversion](https://products.groupdocs.com/conversion/net) you can easily extract content from your archives. For example, a code snippet of extraction from a ZIP archive will look like this:

```csharp
// Load the source ZIP file
using (Converter converter = new Converter("sample.zip"))
{
    converter.Convert(() => new MemoryStream(), (Stream convertedStream, string sourceFileName) =>
    {
        // store extracted content
        string fileName = Path.Combine(outputFolder, sourceFileName);
        Directory.CreateDirectory(Path.GetDirectoryName(fileName)!);
        using (var fs = new FileStream(fileName, FileMode.Create))
        {
            convertedStream.CopyTo(fs);
        }
    }, (_, _) => null);
}

```

Put it simply - you just load a ZIP file into the `Converter` class, provide null convert options and a handler in which to store the result and all the rest will be done by **GroupDocs.Conversion**.

## Extract and convert from a RAR 

You also can convert the archive content during extraction to a desired format. Extraction and conversion to PDF format are also quite simple and natural.
The following code sample demonstrates how to convert the content of a RAR archive to PDF in C# using [GroupDocs.Conversion](https://products.groupdocs.com/conversion/net).

```csharp
// Load the source RAR file
using (Converter converter = new Converter("sample.rar"))
{
    // Set the convert option for PDF format. This will convert each file in the archive to PDF
    PdfConvertOptions options = new PdfConvertOptions();
    int i = 0;
    // Extract and convert to PDF
    converter.Convert(() => new FileStream(Path.Combine(outputFolder, $"converted-{++i}.pdf"), FileMode.Create), options);
}
```
