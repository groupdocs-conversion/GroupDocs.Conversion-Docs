Introduced and documented by Microsoft, the Rich Text Format (RTF) represents a method of encoding formatted text and graphics for use within applications. The format facilitates cross-platform document exchange with other Microsoft Products, thus serving the purpose of interoperability. This capability makes it a standard of data transfer between word processing software and, hence, contents can be transferred from one operating system to another without losing document formatting.

## Steps to convert RTF to PPT in C#

[GroupDocs.Conversion](https://products.groupdocs.com/conversion/net) allows developers to convert the RTF file to PPT format in an easy and intuitive way just using a few lines of code as described below:

* Create an instance of `Converter` class and pass source RTF file path as a constructor parameter. You may specify absolute or relative file path as per your requirements. 
* Create an instance of `PresentationConvertOptions` class and set `Format` property to `GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.PresentationFileType.Ppt`.
* Call `Converter` class `Convert` method and pass the filename for the converted PPT file and the `PresentationConvertOptions` object from the previous step as parameters.

```csharp
// Load the source RTF file
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter("sample.rtf"))
{
    // Set the convert options for PPT format
   var options = new PresentationConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.PresentationFileType.Ppt };
    // Convert to PPT format
    converter.Convert("converted.ppt", options);
}
```
