Files with .DCM extension represent a digital image that stores medical information of patients such as MRIs, CT scans, and ultrasound images. DCM files use DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) image file format and can include patientâ€™s information for reference. It was developed by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) and was meant to standardize the imaging file format for distribution and viewing of medical images.
