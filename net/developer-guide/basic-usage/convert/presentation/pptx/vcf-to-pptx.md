VCF (Virtual Card Format) or vCard is a digital file format for storing contact information. The format is widely used for data interchange among popular information exchange applications. Most operating systems such as Windows and macOS come with default applications to create and open these files. A single VCF file can contain contact information for one or multiple contacts.

## Steps to convert VCF to PPTX in C#

[GroupDocs.Conversion](https://products.groupdocs.com/conversion/net) allows developers to convert the VCF file to PPTX format in an easy and intuitive way just using a few lines of code as described below:

* Create an instance of `Converter` class and pass source VCF file path as a constructor parameter. You may specify absolute or relative file path as per your requirements. 
* Create an instance of `PresentationConvertOptions` class.
* Call `Converter` class `Convert` method and pass the filename for the converted PPTX file and the `PresentationConvertOptions` object from the previous step as parameters.

```csharp
// Load the source VCF file
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter("sample.vcf"))
{
    // Set the convert options for PPTX format
   var options = new PresentationConvertOptions();
    // Convert to PPTX format
    converter.Convert("converted.pptx", options);
}
```
