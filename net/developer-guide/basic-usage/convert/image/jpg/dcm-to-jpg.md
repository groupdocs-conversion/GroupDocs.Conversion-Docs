Files with .DCM extension represent a digital image that stores medical information of patients such as MRIs, CT scans, and ultrasound images. DCM files use DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) image file format and can include patientâ€™s information for reference. It was developed by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) and was meant to standardize the imaging file format for distribution and viewing of medical images.

## Steps to convert DCM to JPG in C#

[GroupDocs.Conversion](https://products.groupdocs.com/conversion/net) allows developers to convert the DCM file to JPG format in an easy and intuitive way just using a few lines of code as described below:

* Create an instance of `Converter` class and pass source DCM file path as a constructor parameter. You may specify absolute or relative file path as per your requirements. 
* Declare `SavePageStream` delegate, which should provide a stream to store converted page of DCM document.
* Create an instance of `ImageConvertOptions` class and set `Format` property to `GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.ImageFileType.Jpg`.
* Call `Converter` class `Convert` method and pass the filename for the converted JPG file and the `ImageConvertOptions` object from the previous step as parameters.

```csharp
// Load the source DCM file
using (Converter converter = new Converter("sample.dcm"))
{
    string outputFileTemplate = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "converted-page-{0}.jpg");
    GroupDocs.Conversion.Contracts.SavePageStream getPageStream = page => new FileStream(string.Format(outputFileTemplate, page), FileMode.Create);

    // Set the convert options for JPG format
    var options = new ImageConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.ImageFileType.Jpg };   
    // Convert to JPG format
    converter.Convert(getPageStream, options);
}
```
