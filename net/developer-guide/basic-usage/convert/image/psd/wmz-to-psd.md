A file with .wmz extension is an intermediate level file generated by older versions of Microsoft Office applications. It can contain embedded equations, clip art, or other vector graphics.

## Steps to convert WMZ to PSD in C#

[GroupDocs.Conversion](https://products.groupdocs.com/conversion/net) allows developers to convert the WMZ file to PSD format in an easy and intuitive way just using a few lines of code as described below:

* Create an instance of `Converter` class and pass source WMZ file path as a constructor parameter. You may specify absolute or relative file path as per your requirements. 
* Declare `SavePageStream` delegate, which should provide a stream to store converted page of WMZ document.
* Create an instance of `ImageConvertOptions` class and set `Format` property to `GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.ImageFileType.Psd`.
* Call `Converter` class `Convert` method and pass the filename for the converted PSD file and the `ImageConvertOptions` object from the previous step as parameters.

```csharp
// Load the source WMZ file
using (Converter converter = new Converter("sample.wmz"))
{
    string outputFileTemplate = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "converted-page-{0}.psd");
    GroupDocs.Conversion.Contracts.SavePageStream getPageStream = page => new FileStream(string.Format(outputFileTemplate, page), FileMode.Create);

    // Set the convert options for PSD format
    var options = new ImageConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.ImageFileType.Psd };   
    // Convert to PSD format
    converter.Convert(getPageStream, options);
}
```
