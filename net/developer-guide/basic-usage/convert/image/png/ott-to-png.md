Files with OTT extension represent template documents generated by applications in compliance with the OASIS' OpenDocument standard format. These are created with word processor applications such as free OpenOffice Writer and can hold settings that can be used to generate new documents from these template files. These settings include page margins, borders, headers, footers, and other page settings. Such templates are used in official documents such as company letterheads and standardized forms.

## Steps to convert OTT to PNG in C#

[GroupDocs.Conversion](https://products.groupdocs.com/conversion/net) allows developers to convert the OTT file to PNG format in an easy and intuitive way just using a few lines of code as described below:

* Create an instance of `Converter` class and pass source OTT file path as a constructor parameter. You may specify absolute or relative file path as per your requirements. 
* Declare `SavePageStream` delegate, which should provide a stream to store converted page of OTT document.
* Create an instance of `ImageConvertOptions` class and set `Format` property to `GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.ImageFileType.Png`.
* Call `Converter` class `Convert` method and pass the filename for the converted PNG file and the `ImageConvertOptions` object from the previous step as parameters.

```csharp
// Load the source OTT file
using (Converter converter = new Converter("sample.ott"))
{
    string outputFileTemplate = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "converted-page-{0}.png");
    GroupDocs.Conversion.Contracts.SavePageStream getPageStream = page => new FileStream(string.Format(outputFileTemplate, page), FileMode.Create);

    // Set the convert options for PNG format
    var options = new ImageConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.ImageFileType.Png };   
    // Convert to PNG format
    converter.Convert(getPageStream, options);
}
```
