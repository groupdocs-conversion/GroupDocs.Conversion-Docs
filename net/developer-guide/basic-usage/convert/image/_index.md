## About Image File Formats

An image file format is a standard method for organizing and storing images on devices like computers, tablets and smartphones. Digital images store image data in 2-dimensional grid of pixels where each pixel is a representation of colour in terms of number of bits. Image file types are classified into vector image formats and raster image formats. 3D Images are another type of vector image file format that is used for managing 3D images.

### Raster Formats

**Raster Graphics** are digital images that comprise of pixels data for representation of colours. These are the most common image types for graphics used for web as well as digital photos. Some of the raster images can be compressed to reduce image file size. Common raster image file extensions and their file formats include **BMP** (Bitmap image file), **PNG** (Portable Network Graphics) and **GIF** (Graphics Interchange File).

### Vector Formats

**Vector images** are defined by 2D points, instead of pixels, which are connected to give a geometric shape to the image. The points have properties that define the direction of paths, color, shape, curve, thickness, and fill. Common vector image file extensions and their file formats include **SVG** (Scalable Vector Graphics), **EPS** (Encapsulated PostScript language) and **PDF** (Portable Document Format).

## Convert PDF to JPG in C#

[GroupDocs.Conversion](https://products.groupdocs.com/conversion/net) allows developers to convert the PDF file to JPG format in an easy and intuitive way just using a few lines of code as described below:

* Create an instance of `Converter` class and pass source PDF file path as a constructor parameter. You may specify absolute or relative file path as per your requirements. 
* Declare `SavePageStream` delegate, which should provide a stream to store converted page of PDF document.
* Create an instance of `ImageConvertOptions` class and set `Format` property to `GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.ImageFileType.Jpg`.
* Call `Converter` class `Convert` method and pass the filename for the converted JPG file and the `ImageConvertOptions` object from the previous step as parameters.

```csharp
// Load the source PDF file
using (Converter converter = new Converter("sample.pdf"))
{
    string outputFileTemplate = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "converted-page-{0}.jpg");
    GroupDocs.Conversion.Contracts.SavePageStream getPageStream = page => new FileStream(string.Format(outputFileTemplate, page), FileMode.Create);

    // Set the convert options for JPG format
    var options = new ImageConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.ImageFileType.Jpg };   
    // Convert to JPG format
    converter.Convert(getPageStream, options);
}
```
