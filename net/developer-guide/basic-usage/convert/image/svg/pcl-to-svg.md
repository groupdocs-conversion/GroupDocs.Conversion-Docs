PCL stands for Printer Command Language which is a Page Description Language introduced by Hewlett Packard (HP). HP created PCL to provide an efficient way of controlling printer features across many different printing devices. The format was originally developed for HPâ€™s dot-matrix and Inkjet printers but has been part of various thermal, matrix, and page printers with the passage of time. The format underwent several different revisions, resulting in different versions where each version was enhanced to meet the demands of time with respect to the printer control features

## Steps to convert PCL to SVG in C#

[GroupDocs.Conversion](https://products.groupdocs.com/conversion/net) allows developers to convert the PCL file to SVG format in an easy and intuitive way just using a few lines of code as described below:

* Create an instance of `Converter` class and pass source PCL file path as a constructor parameter. You may specify absolute or relative file path as per your requirements. 
* Create an instance of `ImageConvertOptions` class and set `Format` property to `GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.ImageFileType.Svg`.
* Call `Converter` class `Convert` method and pass the filename for the converted SVG file and the `ImageConvertOptions` object from the previous step as parameters.

```csharp
// Load the source PCL file
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter("sample.pcl"))
{
    // Set the convert options for SVG format
   var options = new ImageConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.ImageFileType.Svg };
    // Convert to SVG format
    converter.Convert("converted.svg", options);
}
```
