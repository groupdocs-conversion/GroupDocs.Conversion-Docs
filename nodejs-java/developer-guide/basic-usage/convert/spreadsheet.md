Microsoft Excel with its popular XLS and XLSX formats is a recognized authority in the area of working with tabular data, reports, accounting data and numbers. However, there are often situations when installing Excel software for working with spreadsheets is not possible for various reasons. This is exactly the situation when converting the source workbook into another format can be a solution. 

Even though direct converting tables to other formats can be a very complicated process, **GroupDocs.Conversion for Node.js via Java** successfully solves this class of tasks - from the developer's point of view, it is needed to load the source workbook and save the converted document in some other format. Thatâ€™s it!

## Convert Excel workbook to PDF

Nowadays PDF format has become one of the common ways to share documents between people and organizations of any kind. In software development, it is also quite a popular use case to convert Excel workbooks into PDF format. GroupDocs.Conversion keeps great display accuracy when converting XLSX/XLS workbooks to PDF and no additional software is required.  

Use the [Converter](#) class to save an Excel workbook to PDF using its [convert](#) method. There is a complete list of steps that should be followed for XLSX to PDF conversion:  

1. Instantiate an object of the `Converter` class by passing the source XLSX file name into it.
2. Call the `convert` method and specify the output file name along with the [PdfConvertOptions](#) object as we are converting the workbook into PDF format. The converted PDF file will be saved under the selected file name.  

```js
// Load the source XLSX file
const converter = new groupdocs.conversion.Converter("sample.xlsx");
const options = new groupdocs.conversion.PdfConvertOptions();
// Save converted PDF file
converter.convert("converted.pdf", options);
```

## Convert Excel workbook to HTML/MHTML

The GroupDocs.Conversion library allows exporting Excel spreadsheets to HTML and MHTML formats which are popular web formats, also used for emails and other areas.
The main difference between HTML and MHTML is that the latter combines all document content like CSS styles, images, audio etc. into a single file.  
The code snippet for XLSX to HTML or MHTML conversion using JavaScript programming language is pretty simple:  

```js
// Load the source XLSX file
const converter = new groupdocs.conversion.Converter("sample.xlsx");
const options = new groupdocs.conversion.MarkupConvertOptions();
// Save converted HTML file
converter.convert("converted.html", options);
```

When converting to MHTML you may use the same code example as above, just call the `setFormat` method of the [MarkupConvertOptions](#) like this:  

```js
const options = new groupdocs.conversion.MarkupConvertOptions();
options.setFormat(groupdocs.conversion.MarkupFileType.Mhtml);
```

## Convert Excel workbook to DOCX

The GroupDocs.Conversion library empowers you with the ability to convert Microsoft Excel files into a wide range of Microsoft Word formats (please refer to the full list of [supported conversions](#supported-spreadsheet-file-conversions)). The most commonly used Microsoft Word formats are DOCX and DOC, and when converting an XLSX spreadsheet you should specify the desired target format by calling the `setFormat` method of the [WordProcessingConvertOptions](#) object.  

Here is a complete code example for XLSX to DOCX conversion using JavaScript language below:

```js
// Load the source XLSX file
const converter = new groupdocs.conversion.Converter("sample.xlsx");
const options = new groupdocs.conversion.WordProcessingConvertOptions();
// Save converted DOCX file
converter.convert("converted.docx", options);
```

## Convert Excel workbook to PPTX

When it is needed to present Microsoft Excel data and charts to a wide audience it may be more convenient to transform XLS(X) workbook into Microsoft PowerPoint format. The GroupDocs.Conversion library supports such Excel to PowerPoint transformations when workbook spreadsheets are converted to presentation slides.  

Similarly to other conversions, you may choose the desired presentation file format by calling the `setFormat` method of the [PresentationConvertOptions](#) class. PPTX is the default format for presentations so when converting to PPTX, the `setFormat` call may be omitted.  

Please examine the code snippet that demonstrates how to convert XLSX to PPTX using JavaScript language:  

```js
// Load the source XLS file
const converter = new groupdocs.conversion.Converter("sample.xlsx");
cosnt options = new groupdocs.conversion.PresentationConvertOptions();
// Save converted PPTX file
converter.convert("converted.pptx", options);
```
